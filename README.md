# Keyboard
I am very entusisatic about building my own ergonomic split keyboard but I man not shure nor how it should look nor how it should work (I mean capacitive touch using vector movements as keys or with mechanical keys, or both of touch and keys world). I thing, some day I will figure out this and then will start working, but for now, I leave this repo as placeholder and remainder:)

# Keyboard
I am very entusisatic about building my own ergonomic split keyboard but I man not shure nor how it shoud luck nor how it shoud work (I mean capacitive touch using vector movements as keys representivs or with mechanical keys, or both of touch and keys world). I thing, some day I will figure out this and then will start working, but for now, I leve this repo as placeholder and remainder:)
